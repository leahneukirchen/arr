.Dt ARR 1
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm arr
.Nd (re)arrange and select fields on each line
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl 0
.Op Fl P | Fl p Ar padding
.Ar expr
.Op Ar files\ ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
unifies and extends the features of
.Xr cut 1 ,
.Xr paste 1 ,
and provides an alternative to
.Xr dicer 5 .
.Pp
.Nm
will read one line (or zero separated string, when
.Fl 0
is used) from each
.Ar file
passed on the command line,
and then print the result of expanding
.Ar expr .
.Pp
By default, reading continues until all files are exhausted.
Ended files continue generating empty strings,
or
.Ar padding
when
.Fl p
is used.
When
.Fl P
is used, reading stops as soon as one file is exhausted.
.Sh FORMATTING EXPRESSIONS
.Ar expr
is read as a string containing escape sequences
.Ql "%{...}"
which are parsed according to the following EBNF:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
<expr>   ::= <fields> (("|" <char> | "*") <fields>)* ("&" <char>)?
<fields> ::= "~"? <field> ("," <field>)*
<field>  ::= "-"? "\d"+ | ("-"? "\d"+)? ":" ("-"? "\d"+)?
.Ed
.Pp
Fields are specified by their position,
negative numbers count from the end.
Field ranges are written like
.Cm Ar n Ns Cm ":" Ns Ar m
where
.Ar n
and
.Ar m
are optional and default to 1 and -1 respectively.
If
.Ar n
is bigger than
.Ar m ,
fields are expanded in reverse order.
.Pp
Field ranges are combined using
.Cm ","
and an initial
.Cm "~"
negates the whole set of field selections.
.Pp
Selected fields are joined with the last separator,
and then split on
.Ar c
when
.Cm "|" Ns Ar c
is used.
Alternatively,
.Cm "*"
splits byte-wise.
A final
.Cm "&" Ns Ar c
joins the selected fields using
.Ar c
again.
.Pp
The first set of fields corresponds to the lines read from each file.

.Pa /etc/passwd
